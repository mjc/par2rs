# Benchmark Results Summary

Comprehensive benchmarking results showing par2rs performance compared to par2cmdline.

## Test Configuration
- **Corruption**: 512 bytes at file midpoint (generated files) or 1MB at 10% offset (real files)
- **Recovery**: 5% redundancy (PAR2 standard)
- **Iterations**: 10 iterations per test (100MB, 1GB, 10GB), 5 iterations (pre-parallel 10GB baseline)
- **System**: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, 64GB RAM, Linux x86_64

## Performance Results

| File Size | par2cmdline (avg) | par2rs (avg) | Speedup | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|---------|-------|
| 100MB     | 0.980s            | 0.506s       | **1.93x** | Parallel + SIMD |
| 1GB       | 13.679s           | 4.704s       | **2.90x** | Best speedup |
| 10GB      | 114.526s          | 57.243s      | **2.00x** | Large file repair |

## Key Findings

1. **Parallel Reconstruction**: Rayon-based parallel chunk processing provides 1.27x speedup on 10GB files (72.8s serial â†’ 57.2s parallel)
2. **Best for 1GB Files**: 2.90x speedup is the sweet spot between parallel overhead and benefit
3. **Consistent Performance**: par2rs has much lower variance across iterations (2-3% vs par2cmdline's 10-30%)
4. **Scaling**: Performance advantage remains strong from 100MB to 10GB
5. **Memory Efficiency**: Uses ~100MB RAM vs par2cmdline's variable usage (scales with file size)
