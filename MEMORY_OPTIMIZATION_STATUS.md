# Memory Optimization Implementation Status

## Completed
✓ Created RecoverySliceMetadata struct with lazy loading capability
✓ Added tests for RecoverySliceMetadata (all passing)
✓ Removed RecoverySlicePacket struct that loaded all data into memory
✓ Updated Packet enum to not include RecoverySlice variant
✓ Modified packet parsing to skip recovery slices

## In Progress
- Need to update all code that references Packet::RecoverySlice
- Need to create parse_recovery_slice_metadata() function in file_ops.rs
- Need to update repair.rs to use RecoverySliceMetadata
- Need to update RecoverySliceProvider to load data on-demand

## Files That Need Updates
1. src/file_ops.rs - Remove Packet::RecoverySlice match, add metadata parsing
2. src/repair.rs - Use RecoverySliceMetadata instead of RecoverySlicePacket
3. src/reed_solomon/reedsolomon.rs - Update imports
4. src/verify.rs - Remove RecoverySlice handling (not needed for verification)

## Key Design Decisions
- RecoverySliceMetadata stores file path + offset + size (< 200 bytes per slice)
- Recovery data is loaded on-demand during reconstruction only
- Regular packet parsing skips recovery slices entirely
- Separate function parses recovery slice metadata when file path is known

## Expected Impact
- Memory usage during loading: ~1.9GB → <128MB (93% reduction)
- No performance impact (data still read when needed)
- Cleaner separation of concerns
